Run this BEFORE adding a generation. SpriteCollab is community art and its
coverage is not uniform: Sinnoh and Kalos are complete, Paldea is 85%. A gap is
not a failure -- the firmware falls back to a numbered placeholder -- but it has
to be a known number rather than something a player discovers, and a species
with no art anywhere should be kept out of the egg pool.

Upstream is read from the GitHub API rather than by probing each dex number:
one request per hundred species instead of one per species.
