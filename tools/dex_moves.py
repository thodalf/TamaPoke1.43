"""The move list, hand-authored. Source of truth for moves.h via gen_moves.py.

86 moves, trimmed from Gen 1's 165 and then topped up with the cheap early
attacks the early game needs: 63 attacking (three or four per type, a
cheap one and a strong one), 11 stat-stage moves and 2 heals. STRUGGLE at the
end makes 77 -- it is a fallback, not a learnable move.

Not a pure Gen 1 list, and it can't be. dex_types.py gives the 151 their
CURRENT typings, so the dex contains Fairy (Clefable, Mr. Mime), Steel
(Magneton) and Dark types -- and Fairy moves are Gen 6, Steel and Dark moves
are Gen 2. Restricting to Red/Blue's move list would leave exactly those
species with no same-type move to their name. Entries marked LATER below are
in for that reason: they buy STAB for a typing the game already committed to.
Ghost is the same story -- Gen 1 Ghost had no usable attacking move at all,
hence SHADOW BALL.

Display names are capped at 12 characters: four move buttons have to fit
across a 466 px round panel at text size 2. ANCIENTPOWER is the games' own
Gen 3 spelling; DAZZLE GLEAM is ours.

No PP by design. Status conditions (burn/para/sleep/poison) are deliberately
absent for now -- the effect enum has room and they land in a later phase.

    # DARK PULSE, for DARKRAI (491), which dexdata_test caught with no same-type
    # attack once Sinnoh landed. BITE and CRUNCH are the only other Dark moves
    # and both are PHYSICAL, so every special-attacking Dark type had no special
    # STAB; Darkrai is SpA 135 / Atk 90, so neither was usable to it. It learns
    # DARK PULSE by level-up at 27, so this is its real move, not a contrivance.
