// The three gym ladders as DATA. Every entry is hand-authored, so the failure
// mode is a typo that puts a creature outside the dex or a level outside the
// curve -- and a bad dex number here is an out-of-bounds read into DEX_TBL, not
// a strange-looking opponent.
//
// All three ladders are VERIFIED against the games themselves: Kanto by hand
// against FireRed/LeafGreen, and Johto and Hoenn by tools/verify_rosters.py,
// which diffs them against pokecrystal and pokeemerald -- the disassemblies, so
// the games' own tables rather than somebody's transcription. Re-run it after
// touching a roster; it reports zero differences across all 26 trainers.
//
// This test is the cheap always-on half: it cannot know what is canonical, but
// it catches the mistakes that would crash or unbalance the game.
