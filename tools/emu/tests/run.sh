#   flush_test  -- a screen that never calls gfx->flush() leaves the panel
#                  frozen, and headless screenshots CANNOT see it: --shot reads
#                  gfx->buffer() straight out and never consults frameReady.
#                  The training submenu shipped frozen exactly this way.
#   i18n_test   -- STRINGS is positional; a short language row is zero-padded by
#                  the compiler with no diagnostic, silently shifting every
#                  string after the gap in that language only.
