386 by hand is 235 entries of name, typing, evolution target and level -- so
this derives them instead.

**--check is the point of this script.** It regenerates 1..151 and diffs against
what was hand-written. If the derivation reproduces the entries a human made,
the same derivation can be trusted for 152..386; if it does not, the differences
have to be understood before anything is emitted. Run it first, always.
