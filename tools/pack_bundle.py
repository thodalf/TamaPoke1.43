"""Empaqueta los sprites de la SD (tools/sdcard/mons/*.bin) en un .pak POR
REGION para que el instalador web los suba de un clic.

ONE FILE PER REGION, not one big one, and that is forced rather than chosen:
Kanto alone is already ~40 MB, so all three would be ~100 MB -- exactly GitHub's
hard per-file limit, which would make the bundle uncommittable. Splitting also
means a player can install Kanto and stop, which is the whole 40 MB most people
want, and add a region later without re-sending what they already have.

Formato TPAK (little-endian):
  char[4]  "TPAK"
  uint16   count
  count x { uint8 nameLen; char name[nameLen]; uint32 size }   (indice)
  ...datos de cada fichero, en el mismo orden...

El instalador (web/index.html) lo descarga, lo parte por el indice y manda cada
fichero a la placa con el protocolo PUT (igual que tools/send_sd.py).
