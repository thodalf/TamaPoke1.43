// The gym ladders: 8 leaders, the Elite 4 and the Champion for each region,
// with their real teams and levels -- Kanto from FireRed/LeafGreen, Johto from
// Gold/Silver/Crystal, Hoenn from Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald.
//
// HAND-AUTHORED -- not generated. The levels are the real ones and they happen
// to fit this game's curve almost exactly: level is age at 1/hour, a pet retires
// at 73 after three days and caps at 100, so Brock at 12-14 is an afternoon and
// Lance at 54-60 is a well-raised creature. Nothing was rescaled.
//
// There is deliberately no gating. A leader always brings its whole team and you
// bring whoever you have, so attrition is the difficulty: one strong creature
// can sweep Brock but will not survive five of Lance's in a row.

// FOUR ROSTER SLOTS ARE DELIBERATE SUBSTITUTIONS, not transcription errors.
// SpriteCollab has no art for these, so as written they put a bare dex NUMBER on
// screen where a leader's creature should be -- and three of them LEAD, which is
// the first thing you see in the fight:
//
//   ELESA   ZEBSTRIKA  523 -> GALVANTULA 596   (Bug/Electric, still fast)
//   MARLON  CARRACOSTA 565 -> SEISMITOAD 537   (bulky Water)
//   MARSHAL THROH      538 -> HARIYAMA   297   (bulky pure Fighting; see below)
//   MALVA   PYROAR     668 -> DELPHOX    655   (fast special Fire, Kalos)
//
// Each stand-in keeps the leader's specialty type, sits near the original's
// base-stat total and comes from the same region as the ladder, so the fight
// still reads as that region's. Levels are unchanged.
//
// MARSHAL IS THE ONE EXCEPTION, and deliberately. Unova has no pure Fighting
// left once Conkeldurr, Sawk and Mienshao are already on his team and Throh has
// no art: what remains is Gurdurr (BST 405, and Marshal already carries its own
// evolution), the 580-BST musketeer legendaries, or Scrafty -- which GRIMSLEY
// already leads with, so the Fighting specialist would inherit the Dark
// specialist's signature. Hariyama is Hoenn but is what Throh actually was: a
// slow, enormously bulky pure-Fighting grappler, HP 144 to Throh's 120.
//
// This REVERSES the earlier decision to keep art-less mons and let them draw as
// numbers. That was defensible while it affected mid-team slots; a gym leader
// leading with a number is not. roster_test now fails if any team contains a
// species from noart.h, so a future generation cannot reintroduce this quietly.
// It does mean Unova no longer matches B2W2 exactly -- and verify_rosters.py
// cannot catch that, since there is no Gen 5 decomp to diff against.
